;
; Supported dialects:
;  - Borland Turbo Pascal 6.0 with Objects
;  - Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0 with Objects
;  - Borland Pascal 7.0 with Objects
; All reserved words mentioned here are from Borland Pascal 7.0 with Objects,
; but they work with other Borland Turbo Pascal versions and other Pascal
; versions. However some words mentioned here as reserved may not be reserved in
; those Pascal dialects (like in Watcom Pascal or GNU Pascal in ANSI/ISO Pascal
; mode). Should work with Delphi files, too.
;
; Known bugs:
;  - Compiler directives are shown as comments, because they are placed in
;    comments. Even original IDE's (editors) for Borland Pascal 7 and Turbo
;    Pascal 7 display compiler directives as comments! Compiler directives 
;    are listed for completness.
;  - Only five predefined symbols are listed, because other, like VER60 and
;    VER70 are defined in some versions only (because they are determined by
;    those versions; VER60 is defined in Turbo Pascal version 6.0, VER70 is
;    defined in Borland Pascal and Turbo Pascal versions 7.0; Delphi 1.0 is
;    Pascal version 8.0 with VER80 defined and so on).
;  - There are no Delphi-specific or Pascal-for-Windows-specific types (like
;    PStr or PBool), because there are too many of them.
